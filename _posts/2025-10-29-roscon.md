## üí° Closing Thoughts

Every year, ROSCon reminds me why I love this field ‚Äî the openness, collaboration, and shared passion for building intelligent, connected robots.

As we move toward **Physical AI**, **standardized data collection**, and **cross-domain integration**, ROS continues to stand out as the backbone of modern robotics research and deployment.
