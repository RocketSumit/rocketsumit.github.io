I recently had the exciting opportunity to share a session with 330 Primary 4 students at [Rosyth School](https://www.rosyth.moe.edu.sg/) in Singapore, organized by the [James Dyson Foundation](https://www.jamesdysonfoundation.com/). The aim of the session was to inspire young minds to explore the fields of engineering and robotics, showing them how these disciplines can shape the world around them. The students were set to create [Wayang Kulit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayang_kulit) puppets as part of their project, and I was invited to share insights on engineering and robotics to help them make their puppets more dynamic and lifelike.

## Highlights of the Session

The session was designed to spark the students' curiosity, showing them how they could bring movement and life into their creations using basic engineering principles.

1. What is Engineering?

   I began by introducing the concept of engineering, emphasizing how it is about solving problems, creating solutions, and constantly pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible. Whether it‚Äôs designing a bridge or building a robot, engineering is about understanding how things work and improving them. I encouraged the students to think of engineering as a tool for transforming ideas into reality.

2. Dyson‚Äôs Engineering Philosophy

   Next, I shared James Dyson‚Äôs famous philosophy: `We solve the problems others ignore. We engineer better technology and then explain why ours is better. The impossible spurs us on.` This quote encapsulates Dyson‚Äôs approach to engineering‚Äîchallenging conventions, refusing to accept the status quo, and constantly striving for innovation. I explained how Dyson‚Äôs persistence led to breakthroughs like the bagless vacuum cleaner. Dyson famously failed 5,127 times before creating the successful prototype, a testament to the importance of perseverance in engineering. However, I also emphasized that while failure is a part of the process, in today‚Äôs fast-paced world, the key is not just to fail many times but to learn from each failure and fail less as you progress. By embracing failure as a learning experience, we can make success come faster and more efficiently, adapting our approach to solve problems more effectively.

3. Busting Myths About Engineers

   A key part of the session was addressing common misconceptions about engineers. Many people think engineers are simply the ones who fix things or get their hands and clothes dirty working with tools. I clarified that while engineers do solve problems, their role goes beyond repairs; they create new technologies, innovate, and improve the world around us. I also highlighted the growing number of women entering the field, challenging the stereotype that engineering is a male-dominated profession.

4. Robotics and Dynamics in Motion

   We then explored some basic concepts in robotics, such as links, joints, and movement. I showed how these components are used in robotics to create lifelike movement, and how the same principles can be applied to their Wayang Kulit puppets. By incorporating more joints into their puppet designs, the students could make their creations more dynamic and flexible‚Äîjust like robots in motion!

## Q&A and Interactive Discussions

The students were very engaged and asked some excellent questions. One of the most thought-provoking questions came from a student who asked, ‚ÄúWhat if we don‚Äôt have enough resources? What should we focus on in the early stages of our careers?‚Äù I responded by emphasizing the importance of building a strong foundation in the fundamentals, such as math and science. You don‚Äôt need expensive tools or fancy equipment to start‚Äîsimple materials like cardboard can be used for prototyping, and a DIY mindset is key to bringing ideas to life.

## My Reflections on the Experience

Overall, the experience was incredibly rewarding. The students were enthusiastic, eager to learn, and curious about the world of engineering and robotics. They were particularly fascinated by the robot videos I shared, which featured humanoid robots (NAO) dancing to the Gangnam Style song. It was inspiring to watch their eyes light up as they saw the robots in action. They were amazed to learn how robots can be programmed to perform tasks autonomously, in contrast to manually moving puppets by hand. This sparked an interesting discussion about what differentiates robots from puppets‚Äîspecifically, how robots can operate independently and make decisions based on their environment, while puppets rely on human control.

Leaving the session, I felt optimistic about the future of engineering. The next generation is full of potential, and events like this are crucial for nurturing their curiosity and passion for innovation. Who knows? Some of these students might one day become robotics engineers or invent the next groundbreaking technology.

It was truly a fantastic experience, and I‚Äôm grateful to Valery Chong for providing me with the opportunity to share my knowledge with such an enthusiastic group of young minds. I look forward to seeing how their projects turn out and hope that, in some way, I‚Äôve helped inspire them to pursue careers in engineering and robotics in the future!
