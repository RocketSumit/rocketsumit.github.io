I had the incredible opportunity to participate as a judge in the [Art x Tech 2023](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/event-detail/art-x-tech-2023/) workshop at the National University of Singapore (NUS), organized by the [James Dyson Foundation](https://www.jamesdysonfoundation.com/). This unique four-day event brought together 80 pre-university students with diverse backgroundsâ€”some with no prior STEM experienceâ€”to explore the fascinating intersections of art, design, and technology through the lens of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics).

## What is Art x Tech?

Art x Tech is designed to inspire new perspectives by blending creativity with technical problem-solving. Participants were challenged to design and build a robot capable of creating artâ€”flinging paint or materials at a canvas to produce innovative artworks. These robots also needed to meet a functional requirement of traveling at least 20 cm to the painting zone.

The students further showcased their efforts through:

- Presentations explaining their design concepts and creative processes.
- Videos documenting their journey from inspiration to execution.

This blend of technical and creative deliverables made the event a vibrant exploration of STEAM principles.

## The Judging Panel

I was honored to join a distinguished panel of judges, including:

- A/Prof Martin Buist (Vice Dean, Office of Undergraduate Programmes)
- A/Prof Thomas Kong (Deputy Head, Department of Architecture)
- Brennan (Space Faculty)
- Pin Da Tan (Robotics Research Engineer, Dyson)

We evaluated the projects based on the robots' innovative designs, the creativity of the resulting artwork, and the quality of the studentsâ€™ presentations and collaborations.

## My Experience as a Judge

It was exhilarating to see the studentsâ€™ ingenuity in action. Each team brought a unique perspective to the challenge, blending engineering principles with artistic flair. I was impressed by their ability to think critically and creatively, even under the tight timeline of the workshop.

What stood out most was their collaborative spiritâ€”teams worked seamlessly to brainstorm ideas, solve technical issues, and refine their designs. Witnessing their presentations, I was inspired by the depth of thought they put into their robotsâ€™ mechanics and the artistic intent behind their designs. At the end of the workshop, I had the privilege of presenting participation certificates to the students, recognizing their hard work and dedication throughout the event.

## Closing Reflections

After the judging, I had the opportunity to share my thoughts on the event and motivate the students to pursue careers in robotics and engineering. Events like Art x Tech are vital for nurturing a generation of innovators who can think across disciplines.

I would also like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Valery Chong for giving me the opportunity to be part of this inspiring event. It was a truly rewarding experience, and I look forward to seeing these bright minds continue to explore the intersections of art and technology in the future.
