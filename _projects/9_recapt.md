## Intro

As part of an entrepreneurship course at KTH, Stockholm, our team developed an innovative expense-tracking app using Flutter. The app leveraged Google's image-to-text translation library to extract purchase details from receipts, presenting spending trends through engaging visual charts. It was our creative pitch to simplify daily expense management.
