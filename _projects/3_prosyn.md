## Motivation: From Classroom to Code

During my undergraduate biotechnology course in 2016, I had the opportunity to dive
deep into one of the most fascinating processes in biology: protein synthesis.
This process, where cells produce the proteins necessary for life, intrigued me
so much that I decided to take my learning beyond textbooks and lectures. I
wanted to create something interactive, something that could make learning this
complex process engaging and fun. Thatâ€™s how I ended up developing an
educational app on protein synthesis using the Unity engine (v5.4.2f2) for multiple
platforms including android, windows and linux.

## Understanding Protein Synthesis

Protein synthesis is a crucial process that occurs within the cells of all
living organisms. It's the method by which cells create proteins, essential
molecules that perform a wide range of functions, from building cellular
structures to facilitating chemical reactions. The process of protein synthesis
is composed of two main stages: transcription and translation.

Transcription takes place in the nucleus of the cell. During this stage, the
DNA sequence of a gene is used as a template to produce messenger RNA (mRNA).
DNA consists of four nucleotide bases: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C),
and Guanine (G). When DNA is transcribed into RNA, a small change occurs: the
base Uracil (U) replaces Thymine (T). So, RNA is made up of Adenine (A), Uracil
(U), Cytosine (C), and Guanine (G).

Once the mRNA is produced, it leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm,
where translation occurs. During translation, the mRNA is read by the ribosome,
which synthesizes a protein by stringing together amino acids in a specific
order. The mRNA is read in groups of three nucleotides called codons. Each
codon corresponds to a specific amino acid or a signal to start or stop protein
synthesis. For example: AUG is the start codon, which also codes for the amino
acid methionine. GCU codes for the amino acid alanine.

The sequence of these codons on the mRNA determines the sequence of amino acids
in the protein. This process continues until a stop codon (such as UAA, UAG, or
UGA) is encountered, signaling the end of protein synthesis. The pairing of
nucleotides is also crucial in this process. In RNA: Adenine (A) pairs with
Uracil (U). Cytosine (C) pairs with Guanine (G). These pairings ensure that the
genetic code is accurately translated into the protein's amino acid sequence.

## The Game: Synthesizing Proteins

In the educational app I developed, the objective is to synthesize as many
proteins as possible within a given time (10, 20 or 30 secs). The game
challenges players to correctly pair mRNA codons to form the correct amino
acids, mimicking the translation process. To add a layer of difficulty, players
are allowed only two mistakes before the game ends. This approach not only
makes learning about protein synthesis interactive but also reinforces the
importance of accuracy in this biological process.

Developing this app was a rewarding experience, as it allowed me to blend my
passion for science with my interest in game development. I hope that through
this app, others can find the same fascination with protein synthesis that
inspired me during my studies.
