## Intro

The RBO hand 3 [1] is a soft robotic hand developed at Robotics and Biology
Laboratory (RBO) at Technical University of Berlin. It is a highly compliant
hand designed for dexterous grasping. The inherent compliance of the fingers
makes it hard to model them analytically unlike their rigid links counterparts.
Therefore, in this project, we investigate efficient data-driven approach to
learn the forward and inverse kinematic models of the hand to control and
visualize the hand in free space.

We used a small feed-forward network to model the pose of fingertips as a
function of airmass. In addition, palm and T{1-3} bellow actuators are modeled
as revolut joints. The ring and little finger, and thumb form a chain of
connected joints with their respective bellows. The final finger pose is
computed by taking into account airmass in each finger compartments along with
palm and thumb bellows (T1,T2,T3).

## Kinematics-Driven Fingertip Prediction App

Building upon models I developed in my project work, I created a Flutter-based [3] app during my free time to predict fingertip positions from airmass data and vice versa. By integrating forward and inverse kinematics models, this app provides precise and real-time predictions. The project allowed me to repurpose and refine my earlier research while expanding my knowledge in mobile app development.
